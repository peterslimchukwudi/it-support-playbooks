## Network Configuration Labs

### 1. IP Addressing and Subnetting
**Objective:** Design and implement efficient IP addressing schemes.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Assigned IPv4 addresses to network devices
- Implemented subnetting to separate departments
- Verified connectivity using ping and traceroute

**Outcome:**  
Logical and scalable IP addressing structure.

---

### 2. VLAN Configuration and Inter-VLAN Routing
**Objective:** Segment network traffic to improve security and performance.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Created VLANs on access switches
- Assigned switch ports to VLANs
- Configured inter-VLAN routing on router or Layer 3 switch
- Verified communication between VLANs

**Outcome:**  
Improved traffic segmentation and controlled inter-VLAN communication.

---

### 3. DHCP and DNS Configuration
**Objective:** Automate IP assignment and name resolution.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Configured DHCP scopes for multiple VLANs
- Reserved IP addresses for network devices
- Verified DNS resolution for internal hosts

**Outcome:**  
Reliable IP allocation and reduced manual configuration errors.

---

### 4. Bandwidth Expansion and Network Optimization
**Objective:** Improve network performance under increased load.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Identified bandwidth bottlenecks
- Adjusted interface configurations
- Optimized routing paths
- Verified performance improvement using network monitoring tools

**Outcome:**  
Enhanced throughput and improved user experience.

---

### 5. RADIUS Authentication Implementation
**Objective:** Secure network access using centralized authentication.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Installed and configured RADIUS authentication (lab environment)
- Integrated RADIUS with network devices
- Tested user authentication and authorization
- Verified access control enforcement

**Outcome:**  
Centralized and secure user authentication.

## Network Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Host Cannot Reach Default Gateway
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verified IP address configuration
2. Checked subnet mask and gateway settings
3. Tested physical and data link connectivity
4. Validated VLAN assignment

**Resolution:**  
Corrected IP configuration and restored connectivity.

---

### Scenario 2: Intermittent Network Connectivity
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Reviewed interface statistics for errors
2. Checked duplex and speed mismatches
3. Monitored traffic patterns
4. Verified cabling and hardware health

**Resolution:**  
Resolved interface misconfiguration and stabilized network.

---

### Scenario 3: User Authentication Failure
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verified RADIUS server availability
2. Checked shared secrets and authentication policies
3. Reviewed access logs
4. Retested authentication

**Resolution:**  
Authentication restored after configuration correction.
